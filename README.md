## Workshop: Fundamentals of High Performance Computing on CU Research Computing resources.

### Date: 
Wednesday, 16 June, 2021, 1:00p-3:00

### Location: 
This course will be conducted remotely via Zoom. The Zoom URL will be sent to participants via calendar invitation.

### Instructor 
Andrew Monaghan, Research Computing, University of Colorado

### Description: 
This tutorial will introduce you to the [Summit](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/summit) high performance computing (HPC) cluster at CU, which is managed by [CU Research Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/) (RC). Summit has roughly 450 compute nodes including nodes for standard CPU-based computing, GPU-based computing and high-memory computing. Research computing also has other resources including a "condo" computing cluster called [Blanca](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/blanca.html) for groups requiring dedicated resources, a forthcoming on-premise cloud system called "CUmulus", and a forthcoming new HPC cluster called "Alpine", which will eventually replace Summit.  

### Agenda
1. Intro to CURC resources
2. Linux basics and navigating the CURC system
3. Setting up an Anaconda environment (python and R)
4. Using CURC JupyterHub
5. Scheduling batch and interactive jobs on Summit
6. Data transfers (Globus, scp)
7. Managing data for your group


### Prerequisites: 

1) Sign up for a [Research Computing account](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/verify/ucb).  _(Note: when responding to the question "Why are you requesting an account?", you can select the final option, "My research group has purchased condo nodes"). __Please sign up for your account at least 1 day in advance of the workshop__  

2) Make sure your laptop or desktop has a Secure Shell (SSH) client software installed.  If you have Mac OS, this is already installed (via the "Terminal" application).  If you have Windows, there are many options such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) and [GitBASH](https://gitforwindows.org).
